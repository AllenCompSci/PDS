in this folder is a complete set of classes that contain what i believe a more organized way to handle graphics in java
opposed to one huge class with everything in it, ive made seperate classes for the window, drawing, and the keylistener.
i've also heavily commented the files so if you need an ELI5 on the classes there you go 
you're welcome
